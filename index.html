               <center><strong><h1 class="animated fadeInUp fast">What is mole day?</h1></strong></center>
               <center><p class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:.5s;">Mole day is an unofficial holiday celebrated on October 23rd from 6:02am to 6:02pm. It is usually celebrated by chemists, students, and very enthusiastic chemistry teachers, but it can be celebrated by anyone.</p></center>

               <center><strong><h1 class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:1s;">What is a mole?</h1></strong></center>
               <center><p class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:1.5s;">Besides being a furry pest to gardeners, a mole is a unit used to measure particles. Particles are very small, so chemists needed an adequate unit to measure particles, hence the mole was created.</p></center>

               <center><strong><h1 class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:2s;">How big is a mole?</h1></strong></center>
               <center><p class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:2.5s;">The number of particles in a mole is Avogadro's number. Avogadro's number is a big number. And by a big number, I mean a very big number. 6.02214076 * 10<sup>23</sup>(we typically round this number to 6.02 * 10<sup>23</sup>) to be exact. That is:</p></center>
               <div class="animated pulse slower infinite" style="animation-delay:3.5s;"><center><p class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:3s;font-size:19px;">60,221,407,600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000</p></center></div>
               <center><p class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:3.5s;">Now that's a big number, but how big does a mole of a substance look like.</p></center>
               <img src="Images/molesubstances.jpeg" class="animated fadeInUp fast img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" style="animation-delay:4s;border-style:solid;border-color:rgb(167,165,82);border-width:10px;margin:30px;">
               <center><p class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:4.5s;">Pictured above are examples of how big a mole is of the substances(from left to right) zinc, carbon, magnesium, copper, sulfur, silicon, lead, and tin. As you can see, moles of particles don't look that large because particles are very small. It may not seem like Avogadro's number is that big considering how small these moles look, but don't be fooled.</p></center>
               <center><ul>
                 <li class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:5s;">If a quanity of marbles equal to Avoagadro's number were spread over the entire Earth, our planet would be covered to a depth of 3 miles.</li>
                 <li class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:5.5s;">There are around 6.6 billion people on Earth. To equal the population of Avogadro's number, we'd need 9.12 * 10<sup>13</sup> Earths.</li>
                 <li class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:6s;">If you had Avogadro's number in money, you could spend $800 billion a day and not run out of money for 2.06*10<sup>9</sup> years.</li>
               </ul></center>

               <center><strong><h1 class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:6.5s">Why do we use moles?</h1></strong></center>
               <center><p class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:7s;">As was stated before, moles were created as an adequate way to measure particles. Particles are very small. They make up our entire world, and although they aren't the smallest things that make up our world, they are still very small. To put this into perspective, there are more atoms(another word for particles) in one grain of salt than there is grains of sand in all of the beaches in the world. Single atoms or particles are far too small to be measured or weighed; we have to work with lots of them in order to be able to measure and experiment with them. Moles allow chemists to manipulate the subatomic world with macro world units.</p></center>

               <center><strong><h1 class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:8s">How was the mole created?</h1></strong></center>
               <center><p class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:8.5s;">Contrary to what many people believe, the mole and Avogadro’s number was not completely invented by Amedeo Avogadro. As with most things in science, discoveries happen gradually, and are the work of countless scientists. Avogadro’s work is no exception to this.</p></center>
               <img src="Images/amedeo-avogadro.jpeg" class="animated fadeInUp fast img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" style="animation-delay:9s;border-style:solid;border-color:rgb(167,165,82);border-width:10px;margin:30px;">
               <center><p class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:9.5s;">Avogadro’s constant is thought to have originated from another of Avogadro’s discoveries; the discovery that all gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same amount of particles. This ideology later came to be known as Avogadro’s law, and is one of the things he is most famous for.</p></center>
               <img src="Images/avogardos-hypothesis-gas.png" class="animated fadeInUp fast img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" style="animation-delay:10s;border-style:solid;border-color:rgb(167,165,82);border-width:10px;margin:30px;">
               <center><p class="animated fadeInUp fast" style="animation-delay:10.5s;">Despite Avogadro having come up with the explanation for Avogadro’s law, a French chemist and hot hair balloonist by the name of Joseph Gay-Lusaac was the one who actually originated this breakthrough discovery. His work in studying gases stemmed from his fascination with the gases that lifted his balloons. He observed that volumes of gases reacted with each other in ratios of small whole numbers. This observation is demonstrated in the diagram below. Two volumes of carbon monoxide are being reacted with one volume of oxygen to yield two volumes of carbon dioxide. At the time, this perfect yield made no sense until Avogadro was able to use these observations to formulate Avogadro’s law as mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p></center>
